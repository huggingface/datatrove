    """Read data from JSONL files.
        Will read each line as a separate document.

    Args:
        data_folder: a str, tuple or DataFolder object representing a path/filesystem
        paths_file: optionally provide a file with one path per line (without the `data_folder` prefix) to read.
        compression: the compression to use (default: "infer")
        limit: limit the number of documents to read. Useful for debugging
        skip: skip the first n rows
        file_progress: show progress bar for files
        doc_progress: show progress bar for documents
        adapter: function to adapt the data dict from the source to a Document.
            Takes as input: (self, data: dict, path: str, id_in_file: int | str)
                self allows access to self.text_key and self.id_key
            Returns: a dict with at least a "text" and "id" keys
        text_key: the key containing the text data (default: "text").
        id_key: the key containing the id for each sample (default: "id").
        default_metadata: a dictionary with any data that should be added to all samples' metadata
        recursive: whether to search files recursively. Ignored if paths_file is provided
        glob_pattern: pattern that all files must match exactly to be included (relative to data_folder). Ignored if paths_file is provided
        shuffle_files: shuffle the files within the returned shard. Mostly used for data viz. purposes, do not use with dedup blocks
