abstract: "DataTrove is a library to process, filter and deduplicate text data at a very large scale. It provides a set of prebuilt commonly used processing blocks with a framework to easily add custom functionality. DataTrove processing pipelines are platform-agnostic, running out of the box locally or on a slurm cluster. Its (relatively) low memory usage and multiple step design makes it ideal for large workloads, such as to process an LLM's training data."
